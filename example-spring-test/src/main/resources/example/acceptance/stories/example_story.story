Narrative:
In order to		to communicate effectively to the business some functionality
As a 			development team
I want to 		use Behaviour-Driven Development
     
Scenario:  		A scenario is a collection of executable steps of different type
 
Given step 		represents a precondition to an event
When step 		represents the occurrence of the event
Then step 		represents the outcome of the event
 
Scenario:  		Another scenario exploring different combination of events
 
Given 			a [precondition]
When 			a negative event occurs
Then 			a the outcome should [be-captured]    
 
Examples:
|precondition|be-captured|
|abc|be captured    |
|xyz|not be captured|
